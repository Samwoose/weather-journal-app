## How to check out the website
Please keep the structure of the directories and drag the index.html file to your favorite browser such as Chrome.

## Details on each part
-Build Navbar : Get ids of all sections and build a navbar based on them.

-Detection Algorithm: Detect a section that is located on the top in the current viewport.

-Scroll Event Listener: Listen to the scroll event and see if there is any detected section and if so display a special visual effect(circle(s) is(are) hovering on the background)

-Click Event Listener: Listen to the click event and whenever you click one of the sections located in Navbar, it will show the corresponding section you just clicked. 

## Future work
-Some styles can be added. 
-Realistic contents can be added instead of just placeholders.
